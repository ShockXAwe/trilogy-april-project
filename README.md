Group project for trilogy class 2019

Eat, Drink, Live Chicago!

This page was created for our first class project. We had 2 weeks to complete it with a few requirements to fulfill.

We have 3 subsections:
- Eat in Chicago (In this area you will be able to search a certain type of food within the Chicagoland area)
- Drink in Chicago (In this area you will be able to click on a few different buttons depending on the alcohol)
- Live in Chicago (In this area you will get a list of upcoming events with information within Chicago)

Eat in Chicago
We created this section using the Zomato API.

Drink In Chicago
